<h4>Our Inspiration</h4>
<h6>On January 15th, 2014, my 3-year old nephew, Arjun, was diagnosed with ALL
  or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. This was shocking new to my family as my sweet,
   cheerful, always-smiling nephew was a completely healthy kid before the diagnosis.
   He has now undergone treatment for more than a year and still has almost 2 years
   of treatment left. Arjun is 5 years old and fighting the disease like a champ.
Soon after I heard the news, I had to do something to help - my innocent, little
nephew had leukemia and he was only three! Three years old! He shouldn’t have a
care in the world.  I started @SuperDuperArjun on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter
where people from across the globe got involved.  I began by asking friends and
family to hold up a sign with "Super Duper Arjun #YouAreSuperDuper” on it because
it made Arjun smile!  From there, pictures rolled in with countless faces and smiles
showing their support.  I even lost count of how many countries pictures have come from.
There has been a global showing of support for Super Duper Arjun!
I created @SuperDuperArjun to keep his spirits high during the 3.5 years of expected
treatment.  A long, long, long road for Arjun, our family, and our nearest and dearest.

To my surprise, @SuperDuperArjun may have have lifted his parents’ spirits just
as much as they did Arjun's.  As I’ve learned, cancer or other afflictions
affecting kids can be just as tough on the family in some ways - mentally and
emotionally - as the patients themselves.

From my experience as an uncle dealing with a family member having cancer,
 it sucked.  It sucked a lot.  Especially affecting my nephew as an innocent,
 little child who used fit in the crook of my arm as a baby.

I, now, want to expand @SuperDuperArjun to other kids and take the
“Super Duper” as a recognizable symbol.  So many children with illness
and disease could use more support; the mental and emotional challenge is
as important as the physical battle they face each day.
Your Are Super Duper is about them.
