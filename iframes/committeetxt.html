<h2>Committees</h2>
<h4>Sponsorship and Fundraising</h4>
<h5 class="commit">Our intent is to make all of our events free for kids with cancer
  and give them a chance to engage and push their limits, without being limited
  by the cost of the event or financial hardship their families may face.
  In the future, we want to provide an opportunity to thousands of kids
  with serious afflictions - reach out if you want to lend a hand with
  fundraising and finding like-minded sponsors.</h5>

  <h4>Community</h4>
  <h5 class="commit">The Community Committee is designed to interface with families,
     parents and children- our efforts are focused on connecting with
     children with cancer and their families and encourage their involvement
     in the event. We are also involved in garnering local community
     involvement in the event (sponsors, volunteers) and spreading the
      word about our event/purpose through various social medias, etc.</h5>

  <h4>Operations</h4>
  <h5 class="commit">The operations committee is responsible for ensuring that
    You Are Super Duper events are an amazing experience for everyone
    through the management of all logistical and internal business needs.
    Our efforts are focused on event planning, financial management, safety,
    internal operation support, and legal compliance.</h5>

  <h4>Marketing</h4>
  <h5 class="commit">The Marketing Committee creates design and marketing collateral to
    facilitate our community and sponsors  in spreading the word about our
    cause through various social medias and off-line campaigns. We aim to
    create content that will inspire others and engage the world in our journey.</h5>
