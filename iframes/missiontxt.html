<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<h3>Our mission is to help kids with serious health afflictions shoot for the stars.
  We aim to help kids with long-term afflictions or serious illnesses expand and
  surpass their limits by reminding them how AMAZING they are. Whether their own
  imaginary limits are perceived by themselves or by others, we want kids with
  afflictions or illnesses to be and feel like healthy kids - limitless.</h3>
