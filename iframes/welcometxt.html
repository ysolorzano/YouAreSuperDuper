<h3> We are on a journey to create a memorable day of building and launching rockets,
in a shared effort to lift spirits and push limits for all children, particularly
those battling with cancer. The day is focused on unity through various team
building activities designed to spark the imagination and conquer a common goal,
and most of all <b>HAVE FUN!</b>
</h3>
